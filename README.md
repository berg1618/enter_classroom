# enter_classroom
A chrome extension to automate the process of entering in my classes on Classroom.
# How to use
Download the source code, open Google chrome and go to the extension's page. 
After this, you should see, in the top right corner, a slide button that says: developer mode; turn it on. 
Then, click Load unpacked, select the extension's folder and now it's installed.

Open Google classroom, go to a class, and the extension will start reloading the page until a link to a video call appear under class' name. 
As soon as this url shows up, it will be opened in a new tab.
